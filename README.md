# tkinter_experimentation
a dump for my experiments with tkinter on Python

You can play around with anything in here. These are my (mostly) done little tkinter-Projects in Python 3.X
It's mainly games and a few tech-ideas i either don't have the time or creativity to do something better with.

You can use anything from my code, no problem. a little comment in your code, where you got it from would be appreciated though ;)
